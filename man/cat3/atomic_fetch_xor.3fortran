NAME

ATOMIC_FETCH_XOR(3) - [ATOMIC:BIT MANIPULATION] Atomic bitwise XOR
operation with prior fetch

SYNTAX

    call atomic_fetch_xor (atom, value, old, stat)

DESCRIPTION

ATOMIC_FETCH_XOR(ATOM, VALUE, OLD) atomically stores the value of ATOM
in OLD and defines ATOM with the bitwise XOR between the values of ATOM
and VALUE. When STAT is present and the invocation was successful, it is
assigned the value 0. If it is present and the invocation has failed, it
is assigned a positive value; in particular, for a coindexed ATOM, if
the remote image has stopped, it is assigned the value of
iso_fortran_env's stat_stopped_image and if the remote image has failed,
the value stat_failed_image.

ARGUMENTS

    ATOM
        Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of integer type with
        atomic_int_kind kind.

    VALUE
        Scalar of the same type as ATOM. If the kind is different, the
        value is converted to the kind of ATOM.

    OLD
        Scalar of the same type and kind as ATOM.

    STAT
        (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_atomic_fetch_xor
    use iso_fortran_env
    implicit none
    integer(atomic_int_kind) :: atom[*], old
       call atomic_fetch_xor (atom[1], int(b'10100011101'), old)
    end program demo_atomic_fetch_xor
