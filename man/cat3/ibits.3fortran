NAME

IBITS(3) - [BIT:COPY] Bit extraction

SYNTAX

    result = ibits(i, pos, len)

DESCRIPTION

IBITS extracts a field of length LEN from I, starting from bit position
POS and extending left for LEN bits. The result is right-justified and
the remaining bits are zeroed. The value of pos+len must be less than or
equal to the value BIT_SIZE(I).

ARGUMENTS

    I
        The type shall be _integer_.

    POS
        The type shall be _integer_. A value of zero refers to the least
        significant bit.

    LEN
        The type shall be _integer_.

RETURNS

The return value is of type _integer_ and of the same kind as I.

STANDARD

Fortran 95 and later
