NAME

HYPOT(3) - [MATHEMATICS] returns the distance between the point and the
origin.

SYNTAX

    result = hypot(x, y)

       real(kind=KIND) elemental function hypot(x,y) result(value)
       real(kind=KIND),intent(in) :: x, y

where X,Y,VALUE shall all be of the same KIND.

DESCRIPTION

HYPOT(X,Y) is referred to as the Euclidean distance function. It is
equal to SQRT(X2 + Y2), without undue underflow or overflow.

In mathematics, the _Euclidean distance_ between two points in Euclidean
space is the length of a line segment between two points.

HYPOT(X,Y) returns the distance between the point <X,Y> and the origin.

ARGUMENTS

    X
        The type shall be _real_.

    Y
        The type and kind type parameter shall be the same as X.

RETURNS

The return value has the same type and kind type parameter as X.

The result is the positive magnitude of the distance of the point <X,Y>
from the origin <0.0,0.0> .

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_hypot
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : &
     & real_kinds, real32, real64, real128
    implicit none
    real(kind=real32) :: x, y
    real(kind=real32),allocatable :: xs(:), ys(:)
    integer :: i
    character(len=*),parameter :: f='(a,/,SP,*(3x,g0,1x,g0:,/))'

       x = 1.e0_real32
       y = 0.5e0_real32

       write(*,*)
       write(*,'(*(g0))')'point <',x,',',y,'> is ',hypot(x,y)
       write(*,'(*(g0))')'units away from the origin'
       write(*,*)

       ! elemental
       xs=[  x,  x**2,  x*10.0,  x*15.0, -x**2  ]
       ys=[  y,  y**2, -y*20.0,  y**2,   -y**2  ]

       write(*,f)"the points",(xs(i),ys(i),i=1,size(xs))
       write(*,f)"have distances from the origin of ",hypot(xs,ys)
       write(*,f)"the closest is",minval(hypot(xs,ys))

    end program demo_hypot

Results:

       point <1.00000000,0.500000000> is 1.11803401
       units away from the origin

       the points

          +1.00000000 +0.250000000
          +10.0000000 -10.0000000
          +15.0000000 +0.250000000
          -1.00000000 -0.250000000
       have distances from the origin of
          +1.11803401 +1.03077638
          +14.1421356 +15.0020828
          +1.03077638
       the closest is
          +1.03077638
