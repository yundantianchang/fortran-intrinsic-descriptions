NAME

NUM_IMAGES(3) - [COLLECTIVE] Number of images

SYNTAX

    result = num_images(distance, failed)

DESCRIPTION

Returns the number of images.

ARGUMENTS

    DISTANCE
        (optional, INTENT(IN)) Nonnegative scalar integer

    FAILED
        (optional, INTENT(IN)) Scalar logical expression

RETURNS

Scalar default-kind _integer_. If DISTANCE is not present or has value
0, the number of images in the current team is returned. For values
smaller or equal distance to the initial team, it returns the number of
images index on the ancestor team which has a distance of DISTANCE from
the invoking team. If DISTANCE is larger than the distance to the
initial team, the number of images of the initial team is returned. If
FAILED is not present the total number of images is returned; if it has
the value .true., the number of failed images is returned, otherwise,
the number of images which do have not the failed status.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_num_images
    implicit none
    integer :: value[*]
    integer :: i

       value = this_image()
       sync all
       if (this_image() == 1) then
         do i = 1, num_images()
           write(*,'(2(a,i0))') 'value[', i, '] is ', value[i]
         end do
       endif

    end program demo_num_images

STANDARD

Fortran 2008 and later. With DISTANCE or FAILED argument, TS 18508 or
later
