NAME

ANY(3) - [ARRAY REDUCTION] determines if any of the values in the
logical array are true.

SYNTAX

    result = any(mask, dim)

DESCRIPTION

ANY(MASK, DIM) determines if any of the values in the logical array MASK
along dimension DIM are .TRUE..

ARGUMENTS

    MASK
        the type of the argument shall be _logical_ and it shall not be
        scalar.

    DIM
        (optional) dim shall be a scalar integer with a value that lies
        between one and the rank of mask.

RETURNS

ANY(MASK) returns a scalar value of type _logical_ where the kind type
parameter is the same as the kind type parameter of MASK. If DIM is
present, then ANY(MASK, DIM) returns an array with the rank of MASK
minus 1. The shape is determined from the shape of MASK where the DIM
dimension is elided.

1.  ANY(MASK) is true if any element of MASK is true; otherwise, it is
    .FALSE.. It also is false if MASK has zero size.

2.  If the rank of MASK is one, then ANY(MASK, DIM) is equivalent to
    ANY(MASK). If the rank is greater than one, then ANY(MASK, DIM) is
    determined by applying ANY() to the array sections.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_any
    implicit none
    logical l
       l = any([.true., .true., .true.])
       print *, l
       call section
       contains
         subroutine section
         integer a(2,3), b(2,3)
           a = 1
           b = 1
           b(2,2) = 2
           print *, any(a .eq. b, 1)
           print *, any(a .eq. b, 2)
         end subroutine section
    end program demo_any

Results:

        T
        T T T
        T T
