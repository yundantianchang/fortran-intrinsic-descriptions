NAME

SHIFTR(3) - [BIT:SHIFT] shift bits right (GFDL)

SYNTAX

    result = shiftr(i, shift)

DESCRIPTION

Returns a value corresponding to I with all of the bits shifted right by
SHIFT places. If the absolute value of SHIFT is greater than
BIT_SIZE(I), the value is undefined. Bits shifted out from the right end
are lost, and bits shifted in from the left end are set to 0.

ARGUMENTS

        The type shall be _integer_.

    SHIFT
