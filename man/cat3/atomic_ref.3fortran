NAME

ATOMIC_REF(3) - [ATOMIC] Obtaining the value of a variable atomically
(GFDL)

SYNTAX

    call atomic_ref(value, atom, stat)

DESCRIPTION

ATOMIC_REF(VALUE, ATOM) atomically assigns the value of the variable
ATOM to VALUE. When STAT is present and the invocation was successful,
it is assigned the value 0. If it is present and the invocation has
failed, it is assigned a positive value; in particular, for a coindexed
ATOM, if the remote image has stopped, it is assigned the value of
iso_fortran_env's STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE and if the remote image has failed,
the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

ARGUMENTS

    VALUE
        Scalar of the same type as ATOM. If the kind is different, the
        value is converted to the kind of ATOM.

    ATOM
        Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of either integer type with
        atomic_int_kind kind or logical type with atomic_logical_kind
        kind.

    STAT
        (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_atomic_ref
    use iso_fortran_env
    implicit none
    logical(atomic_logical_kind) :: atom[*]
    logical :: val
       call atomic_ref( val, atom[1] )
       ! ```
       call atomic_ref( val, atom[1] )
       if (val) then
          print *, "Obtained"
       endif
    end program demo_atomic_ref

STANDARD

Fortran 2008 and later; with STAT, TS 18508 or later
