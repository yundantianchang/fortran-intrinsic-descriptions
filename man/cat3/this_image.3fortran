NAME

THIS_IMAGE(3) - [COLLECTIVE] Cosubscript index of this image (GFDL)

SYNTAX

    result = this_image() result = this_image(distance) &
             & result = this_image(coarray, dim)

DESCRIPTION

Returns the cosubscript for this image.

ARGUMENTS

    DISTANCE
        (optional, INTENT(IN)) Nonnegative scalar integer (not permitted
        together with COARRAY).

    COARRAY
        Coarray of any type (optional; if DIM present, required).

    DIM
        default integer scalar (optional). If present, DIM shall be
        between one and the corank of COARRAY.

RETURNS

Default integer. If COARRAY is not present, it is scalar; if DISTANCE is
not present or has value 0, its value is the image index on the invoking
image for the current team, for values smaller or equal distance to the
initial team, it returns the image index on the ancestor team which has
a distance of DISTANCE from the invoking team. If DISTANCE is larger
than the distance to the initial team, the image index of the initial
team is returned. Otherwise when the COARRAY is present, if DIM is not
present, a rank-1 array with corank elements is returned, containing the
cosubscripts for COARRAY specifying the invoking image. If DIM is
present, a scalar is returned, with the value of the DIM element of
THIS_IMAGE(COARRAY).

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_this_image
    implicit none
    integer :: value[*]
    integer :: i
       value = this_image()
       sync all
       if (this_image() == 1) then
          do i = 1, num_images()
             write(*,'(2(a,i0))') 'value[', i, '] is ', value[i]
          end do
       endif
    end program demo_this_image

Results:

       value[1] is 1

! ! Check whether the current image is the initial image if
(this_image(huge(1)) /= this_image()) error stop "something is rotten
here" ```

STANDARD

Fortran 2008 and later. With DISTANCE argument, TS 18508 or later
