NAME

STORAGE_SIZE(3) - [BIT:INQUIRY] Storage size in bits

SYNTAX

    result = storage_size(a, kind)

DESCRIPTION

Returns the storage size of argument A in bits.

ARGUMENTS

    A
        Shall be a scalar or array of any type.

    KIND
        (Optional) shall be a scalar integer constant expression.

RETURNS

The result is a scalar integer with the kind type parameter specified by
KIND (or default integer type if KIND is missing). The result value is
the size expressed in bits for an element of an array that has the
dynamic type and type parameters of A.

EXAMPLES

Sample program

    program demo_storage_size
    implicit none
       write(*,*)'size of integer       ',storage_size(0)
       write(*,*)'size of real          ',storage_size(0.0)
       write(*,*)'size of logical       ',storage_size(.true.)
       write(*,*)'size of complex       ',storage_size((0.0,0.0))
       write(*,*)'size of integer array ',storage_size([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
    end program demo_storage_size

Results:

        size of integer                 32
        size of real                    32
        size of logical                 32
        size of complex                 64
        size of integer array           32
