NAME

EVENT_QUERY(3) - [COLLECTIVE] Query whether a coarray event has occurred

SYNTAX

    call event_query(event, count, stat)

DESCRIPTION

EVENT_QUERY assigns the number of events to COUNT which have been posted
to the EVENT variable and not yet been removed by calling EVENT_WAIT.
When STAT is present and the invocation was successful, it is assigned
the value 0. If it is present and the invocation has failed, it is
assigned a positive value and COUNT is assigned the value -1.

ARGUMENTS

    EVENT
        (intent(in)) Scalar of type event_type, defined in
        iso_fortran_env; shall not be coindexed.

    COUNT
        (intent(out))Scalar integer with at least the precision of
        default _integer_.

    STAT
        (OPTIONAL) Scalar default-kind _integer_ variable.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_event_query
    use iso_fortran_env
    implicit none
    type(event_type) :: event_value_has_been_set[*]
    integer :: cnt
       if (this_image() == 1) then
          call event_query(event_value_has_been_set, cnt)
          if (cnt > 0) write(*,*) "Value has been set"
       elseif (this_image() == 2) then
          event post(event_value_has_been_set[1])
       endif
    end program demo_event_query
