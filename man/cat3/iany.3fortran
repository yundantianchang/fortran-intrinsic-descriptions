NAME

IANY(3) - [BIT:LOGICAL] Bitwise or of array elements (GFDL)

SYNTAX

      result = iany(array, mask)

        or

      result = iany(array, dim, mask)

DESCRIPTION

Reduces with bitwise or (inclusive or) the elements of ARRAY along
dimension DIM if the corresponding element in MASK is .TRUE..

ARGUMENTS

    ARRAY
        Shall be an array of type _integer_

    DIM
        (Optional) shall be a scalar of type _integer_ with a value in
        the range from 1 TO N, where N equals the rank of ARRAY.

    MASK
        (Optional) shall be of type _logical_ and either be a scalar or
        an array of the same shape as ARRAY.

RETURNS

The result is of the same type as ARRAY.

If DIM is absent, a scalar with the bitwise _or_ of all elements in
ARRAY is returned. Otherwise, an array of rank N-1, where N equals the
rank of ARRAY, and a shape similar to that of ARRAY with dimension DIM
dropped is returned.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_iany
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : integer_kinds, &
     & int8, int16, int32, int64
    implicit none
    integer(kind=int8) :: a(2)
         a(1) = int(b'00100100')
         a(2) = int(b'01101010')
         print '(b8.8)', iany(a)
    end program demo_iany

Results:

       01101110

STANDARD

Fortran 2008 and later
