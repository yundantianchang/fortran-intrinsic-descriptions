NAME

EOSHIFT(3) - [TRANSFORMATIONAL] End-off shift elements of an array
(GFDL)

SYNTAX

    result = eoshift(array, shift, boundary, dim)

DESCRIPTION

EOSHIFT(ARRAY, SHIFT[, BOUNDARY, DIM]) performs an end-off shift on
elements of ARRAY along the dimension of DIM. If DIM is omitted it is
taken to be 1. DIM is a scalar of type _integer_ in the range of 1 <=
DIM <= N where "N" is the rank of ARRAY. If the rank of ARRAY is one,
then all elements of ARRAY are shifted by SHIFT places. If rank is
greater than one, then all complete rank one sections of ARRAY along the
given dimension are shifted. Elements shifted out one end of each rank
one section are dropped. If BOUNDARY is present then the corresponding
value of from BOUNDARY is copied back in the other end. If BOUNDARY is
not present then the following are copied in depending on the type of
ARRAY.

*Array Type* - *Boundary Value*

-   Numeric 0 of the type and kind of ARRAY

-   Logical .false.

-   CHARACTER(LEN) LEN blanks

ARGUMENTS

    ARRAY
        May be any type, not scalar.

    SHIFT
        The type shall be _integer_.

    BOUNDARY
        Same type as ARRAY.

    DIM
        The type shall be _integer_.

RETURNS

Returns an array of same type and rank as the ARRAY argument.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_eoshift
    implicit none
        integer, dimension(3,3) :: a
        a = reshape( [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], [ 3, 3 ])
        print '(3i3)', a(1,:)
        print '(3i3)', a(2,:)
        print '(3i3)', a(3,:)
        a = eoshift(a, SHIFT=[1, 2, 1], BOUNDARY=-5, DIM=2)
        print *
        print '(3i3)', a(1,:)
        print '(3i3)', a(2,:)
        print '(3i3)', a(3,:)
    end program demo_eoshift

Results:

         1  4  7
         2  5  8
         3  6  9

         4  7 -5
         8 -5 -5
         6  9 -5
