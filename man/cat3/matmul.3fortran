DESCRIPTION

Performs a matrix multiplication on numeric or logical arguments.

ARGUMENTS

    MATRIX_A
        An array of _integer_, _real_, _complex_, or _logical_ type,
        with a rank of one or two.

    MATRIX_B
        An array of _integer_, _real_, or _complex_ type if MATRIX_A is
        of a numeric type; otherwise, an array of _logical_ type. The
        rank shall be one or two, and the first (or only) dimension of
        MATRIX_B shall be equal to the last (or only) dimension of
        MATRIX_A.

RETURNS
