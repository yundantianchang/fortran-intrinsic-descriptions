NAME

ATOMIC_ADD(3) - [ATOMIC] Atomic ADD operation (GFDL)

SYNTAX

    call atomic_add (atom, value, stat)

DESCRIPTION

ATOMIC_AD(ATOM, VALUE) atomically adds the value of VAR to the variable
ATOM. When STAT is present and the invocation was successful, it is
assigned the value 0. If it is present and the invocation has failed, it
is assigned a positive value; in particular, for a coindexed ATOM, if
the remote image has stopped, it is assigned the value of
iso_fortran_env's stat_stopped_image and if the remote image has failed,
the value stat_failed_image.

ARGUMENTS

    ATOM
        Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of integer type with
        atomic_int_kind kind.

    VALUE
        Scalar of the same type as ATOM. If the kind is different, the
        value is converted to the kind of ATOM.

    STAT
        (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_atomic_add
    use iso_fortran_env
    implicit none
    integer(atomic_int_kind) :: atom[*]
       call atomic_add (atom[1], this_image())
    end program demo_atomic_add
