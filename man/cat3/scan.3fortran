NAME

SCAN(3) - [CHARACTER:SEARCH] Scan a string for the presence of a set of
characters (GFDL)

SYNTAX

    result = scan(string, set[, back [, kind]])

DESCRIPTION

Scans a STRING for any of the characters in a SET of characters.

If BACK is either absent or equals .FALSE., this function returns the
position of the leftmost character of STRING that is in SET. If BACK
equals .TRUE., the rightmost position is returned. If no character of
SET is found in STRING, the result is zero.

ARGUMENTS

    STRING
        Shall be of type _character_.

    SET
        Shall be of type _character_.

    BACK
        (Optional) shall be of type _logical_.

    KIND
        (Optional) An _integer_ initialization expression indicating the
        kind parameter of the result.

RETURNS

The return value is of type _integer_ and of kind KIND. If KIND is
absent, the return value is of default integer kind.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_scan
    implicit none
       write(*,*) scan("fortran", "ao")          ! 2, found 'o'
       write(*,*) scan("fortran", "ao", .true.)  ! 6, found 'a'
       write(*,*) scan("fortran", "c++")         ! 0, found none
    end program demo_scan

Results:

                  2
                  6
                  0

STANDARD

Fortran 95 and later, with KIND argument - Fortran 2003 and later
