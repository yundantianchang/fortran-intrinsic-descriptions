NAME

SHAPE(3) - [ARRAY INQUIRY] Determine the shape of an array

SYNTAX

    result = shape(source, kind)

DESCRIPTION

Determines the shape of an array.

ARGUMENTS

    SOURCE
        Shall be an array or scalar of any type. If SOURCE is a pointer
        it must be associated and allocatable arrays must be allocated.

    KIND
        (Optional) An _integer_ initialization expression indicating the
        kind parameter of the result.

RETURNS

An _integer_ array of rank one with as many elements as SOURCE has
dimensions. The elements of the resulting array correspond to the extend
of SOURCE along the respective dimensions. If SOURCE is a scalar, the
result is the rank one array of size zero. If KIND is absent, the return
value has the default integer kind otherwise the specified kind.

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_shape
    implicit none
    character(len=*),parameter :: all='(*(g0,1x))'
    integer, dimension(-1:1, -1:2) :: a
       print all, 'shape of array=',shape(a)
       print all, 'shape of constant=',shape(42)
       print all, 'size of shape of constant=',size(shape(42))
       print all, 'ubound of array=',ubound(a)
       print all, 'lbound of array=',lbound(a)
    end program demo_shape

Results:

       shape of array= 3 4
       shape of constant=
       size of shape of constant= 0
       ubound of array= 1 2
       lbound of array= -1 -1

STANDARD

Fortran 95 and later; with KIND argument Fortran 2003 and later
