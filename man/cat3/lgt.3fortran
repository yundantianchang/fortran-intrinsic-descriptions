NAME

LGT(3) - [CHARACTER:COMPARE] Lexical greater than

SYNTAX

    result = lgt(string_a, string_b)

DESCRIPTION

Determines whether one string is lexically greater than another string,
where the two strings are interpreted as containing ASCII character
codes. If the String A and String B are not the same length, the shorter
is compared as if spaces were appended to it to form a value that has
the same length as the longer.

In general, the lexical comparison intrinsics LGE, LGT, LLE, and LLT
differ from the corresponding intrinsic operators .ge., .gt., .le., and
.lt., in that the latter use the processor's character ordering (which
is not ASCII on some targets), whereas the former always use the ASCII
ordering.

ARGUMENTS

    STRING_A
        Shall be of default _character_ type.

    STRING_B
        Shall be of default _character_ type.

RETURNS

Returns .true. if string_a > string_b, and .false. otherwise, based on
the ASCII ordering.

STANDARD

FORTRAN 77 and later
