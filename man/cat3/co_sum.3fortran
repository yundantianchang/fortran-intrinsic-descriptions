NAME

CO_SUM(3) - [COLLECTIVE] Sum of values on the current set of images
(GFDL)

SYNTAX

    call co_sum(a, result_image, stat, errmsg)

DESCRIPTION

co_sum sums up the values of each element of A on all images of the
current team. If result_image is present, the summed-up values are
returned in A on the specified image only and the value of A on the
other images become undefined. If result_image is not present, the value
is returned on all images. If the execution was successful and STAT is
present, it is assigned the value zero. If the execution failed, STAT
gets assigned a nonzero value and, if present, ERRMSG gets assigned a
value describing the occurred error.

ARGUMENTS

    A
        shall be an integer, real or complex variable, which has the
        same type and type parameters on all images of the team.

    RESULT_IMAGE
        (optional) a scalar integer expression; if present, it shall
        have the same the same value on all images and refer to an image
        of the current team.

    STAT
        (optional) a scalar integer variable

    ERRMSG
        (optional) a scalar character variable

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_co_sum
    implicit none
    integer :: val
       val = this_image()
       call co_sum(val, result_image=1)
       if (this_image() == 1) then
          ! prints (n**2 + n)/2, with n = num_images()
          write(*,*) "The sum is ", val
       endif
    end program demo_co_sum

Results:

        The sum is            1
