NAME

SELECTED_REAL_KIND(3) - [KIND] Choose real kind (GFDL)

SYNTAX

    result = selected_real_kind(p, r, radix)

DESCRIPTION

SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P, R, RADIX) return the kind value of a real data
type with decimal precision of at least P digits, exponent range of at
least R, and with a radix of RADIX.

ARGUMENTS

    P
        (Optional) shall be a scalar and of type _integer_.

    R
        (Optional) shall be a scalar and of type _integer_.

    RADIX
        (Optional) shall be a scalar and of type _integer_.

Before FORTRAN 2008, at least one of the arguments R or P shall be
present; since FORTRAN 2008, they are assumed to be zero if absent.

RETURNS

selected_real_kind returns the value of the kind type parameter of a
real data type with decimal precision of at least P digits, a decimal
exponent range of at least R, and with the requested RADIX. If the RADIX
parameter is absent, real kinds with any radix can be returned. If more
than one real data type meet the criteria, the kind of the data type
with the smallest decimal precision is returned. If no real data type
matches the criteria, the result is

-   -1 if the processor does not support a real data type with a
    precision greater than or equal to P, but the R and RADIX
    requirements can be fulfilled

    -   -2 if the processor does not support a real type with an
        exponent range greater than or equal to R, but P and RADIX are
        fulfillable

    -   -3 if RADIX but not P and R requirements are fulfillable

    -   -4 if RADIX and either P or R requirements are fulfillable

    -   -5 if there is no real type with the given RADIX

EXAMPLES

Sample program:

    program demo_selected_real_kind
    implicit none
    integer,parameter :: p6 = selected_real_kind(6)
    integer,parameter :: p10r100 = selected_real_kind(10,100)
    integer,parameter :: r400 = selected_real_kind(r=400)
    real(kind=p6) :: x
    real(kind=p10r100) :: y
    real(kind=r400) :: z

       print *, precision(x), range(x)
       print *, precision(y), range(y)
       print *, precision(z), range(z)
    end program demo_selected_real_kind

Results:

                  6          37
                 15         307
                 18        4931

STANDARD

Fortran 95 and later; with RADIX - Fortran 2008 and later
